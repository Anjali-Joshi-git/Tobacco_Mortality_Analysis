## 📌 Project Summary

* This project investigates whether UK smoking-related data can be used to build a reliable tobacco-attributable mortality prediction model.
* Through data cleaning, epidemiological reasoning, and exploratory visualizations, the study concludes that mortality prediction is not feasible with the currently available dataset.
* Instead, the project transforms into a robust analytical and epidemiology-driven report, supported by clear insights and validated visualizations.

## 🎯 Objectives
Original Goal
1. Build a machine learning model predicting tobacco-related mortality using:
2. UK smoking indicators
3. Epidemiology parameters
4. Long-term risk relationships

## Final Evidence-Based Goal
1. Perform a validated analytical study, including:
2. Dataset cleaning & integration
3. Trend analysis
4. Epidemiology-aligned interpretation
5. Clear scientific communication
6. Visual insights

## 🧪 Methodology
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Removal of invalid entries
* Alignment of years across datasets
* Missing value handling
* Validation of variable relationships

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Smoking rate trends
* Annual indicator fluctuations
* Correlation checks
* Epidemiological baseline comparison

### 3️⃣ Epidemiological Logic Applied

* Used established parameters such as:
* Smoking Attributable Fraction
* Relative Risk of smokers
* Lag effect (10–20 years)
* Baseline mortality rate

These helped evaluate whether the dataset could support predictive modeling.

# 📊 Key Visual Insights
## 📈 Smoking Rate Decline (plot_1.png)
Shows consistent downward trends in UK smoking prevalence over time.

## 📉 Indicator Comparison (plot_2.jpg)
Reveals which tobacco-related indicators carry meaningful patterns.

## 📅 Yearly Trends (plot_3.png)
Shows structural behavior of the dataset across years.
These visualizations are integrated into the final PDF report.

## ⚠️ Why ML Modelling Was Not Pursued

* During validation, the data failed key requirements for mortality prediction:
* Missing values in critical variables
* Insufficient longitudinal depth
* Weak mortality signal
* Epidemiological inconsistency
* No robust target variable

## Conclusion:
A machine learning model would yield unreliable or misleading predictions.

## ✅ Final Outcome
1. Rather than pushing an invalid model, the project delivers:
2. A high-quality analytical research report
3. Cleaned dataset and structured notebook
4. Epidemiology-based reasoning
5. Clear visual communication
6. Guidance for future ML feasibility
7. This aligns with best practices in responsible data science.
